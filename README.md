# SeekAndDelete

Long story short, I couldn't find a targeted deletion tool that I liked so I made my own.

This tool is being developed with digital forensics practitioners in mind. The goal here is to make a tool for practitioners with data remediation needs.

Ultimately, I'd like to add in overwrite capabilities (currently does not overwrite files it deletes) and the ability to overwrite unallocated space.

I'll add input instructions, etc. here later on.
